Computer Specs 

Brand model name/number is Apple the Macbook Air (Retina, 13 inch, 2019) laptop  

The Operating System of my Macbook Air is known to be mac0S Mojave, which is a chip feature. A macOS Mojave is a chip feature on your laptop where it could support you in editing your photos with Quick Look Markup,  and well organize your computer’s desktop with Stacks. It even comes with dark mode which is more interpreted for aesthetics rather than productivity.  You may not have Quick Look Markup or Stacks as it’s informed that not all regions have it and my laptop, in particular, doesn’t have that feature meaning that this region doesn’t have it available.  Furthermore, this system is to contain your security updates along with bug fixes for your mac,  controls the solid performances, access to connecting your Ipad screen to your laptop for a second screen, other several amplifications. The macOS Mojave also has 32-bit app support to monitor your apps before being upgraded. 

My Macbook Air's CPU is noted to be a 1.6GHz dual core 8th generation Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz (i5-8210Y). The CPU is stated to be an M1 chip (Apple’s first system on a chip) that attributes an 8-core CPU including 4 high-efficiency cores, and high-performance cores with combining a GPU that reaches the 8 cores. The Macbook Air’s CPU is a bit over 3x faster than the previous generation product, and the GPU is 5x faster. 

The RAM is 8GB for the Macbook Air (Retina, 13 inches, 2019). A RAM provides your computer with applications in an area thats on short-term grounds, it's when you store and get availability to your data. On another note, the data is being held in the RAM to  be in a place that is less systematic instead. Such as, the Solid State Hard Drive also known as the SSD. This is useful and applicable for when needing to place usual data that programs are consistent in use of. It’s for short-term data identical to the human brain, as it has something called “short term memory loss” and in technology,  it’s described as  “short term” data. 

This Macbook Air storage is specifically 128GB of SSD. The storage of your laptop contradicts to a RAM even though it corresponds to each other in a logical way.  The reason in this case is storage is based on the long term instead of the short term which included is to give you the capability to add access data. Another component is it does involve the Solid State Hard Drive, in easier terms, just Hard Drive or SSD. To add, a RAM also doesn’t contribute an SSD making them differentiate. 

The Wifi of Macbook Air 13 inch of 2019 is 802.11 ac, and The Bluetooth is Bluetooth 4.2. Although WiFi/ Bluetooth are similar because they are both wireless technology for joining other devices, They are also different because WIFI is typically utilized to join your electronics to the internet, while Bluetooth is just for linking your electronics to each other.

The Computers Ports are dual Thunderbolts 3 ports which is where you charge your laptop. Another is a headphone jack to plug in your wired ear or head phones. 

Commnetary 

Yes, I do like my computer. My history with this computer is I’ve been using it for the third year and haven’t come across any major problems meaning it still generates efficiently till this day. 

My computer’s performance is affected by its hardware configuration is it does in fact slow down when here and there my screen gets stuck, leave so many tabs/window open, and when is constantly being filled with varieties that decrease your storage which is one of the terms mentioned above. Another is the RAM and it connects to the storage logically because the memory begins to lose space more and more as I continue to add things to my laptop having it stop being saved into my iCloud or memory as there’s no more room for more to be included and has reached its limit. Overall meaning even though it still works great, its efficiency has still lowered a bit because of the extra storage I’m applying.
